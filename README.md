# chatbot_nltk
This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot is designed to respond to basic user inputs such as greetings, questions about the weather, and general conversation starters. It uses predefined responses mapped to specific keywords or phrases to generate its replies. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how basic natural language processing techniques like tokenization can be used to build a working chatbot without any machine learning. The chatbot works via the command line and runs continuously until the user types an exit command. It uses NLTK's word tokenizer to process the user's input, matches it against a dictionary of predefined responses, and returns a suitable reply. This project is ideal for beginners who are getting started with NLP and want to understand how to build interactive programs using basic Python constructs and libraries. To run this project, make sure Python is installed, and install the nltk library using pip install nltk. Also, download NLTK's 'punkt' tokenizer by running nltk.download('punkt') in your script. The chatbot can be further extended by adding more intents, integrating a GUI using Tkinter, or even moving towards an intent classification model using machine learning. The file chat_bot_Nltk.ipynb contains the entire chatbot logic written in Jupyter Notebook. The project is open-source and available under the MIT License. Contributions are welcome via pull requests. You can fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request with your enhancements.
